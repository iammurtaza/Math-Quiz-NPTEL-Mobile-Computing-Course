# Math-Quiz-NPTEL-Mobile-Computing-Course
A math quiz app which asks the user whether the given number is prime or not. Learned along the NPTEL course.

This app was made to understand intents as in how are queries and results passed on between activies. The app asks user a series
of questions about whether a number is prime or not. I have employed optimization for the calculation of primes though it 
doesn't really make any performance difference.

Also, there is an option to cheat(passing on the answer to another activity) or to have a hint.
It is a simple app if anyone has any use for it feel free to download and do whatever you want to with it.
